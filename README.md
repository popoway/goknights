## Description

Inspired by numerous inquiries and questions from incoming freshmen during new student orientation this summer, and the lack of official college app, GoKnights is created in order to serve as a centralized destination to showcase some of the highlighted student services and resources available on campus.

This project is currently under development and will be updated periodically.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Getting Started

Below are some brief instructions on setting up this project *locally*. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

**ðŸ›‘ If you only want to download and use the app your phone, not code and debug it, you should scroll up and use [one of these buttons](#readme-top) instead. ðŸ›‘**

### Prerequisites

* [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for cross-platform development
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) for iOS dependencies
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) for Android dependencies
* [Azure OpenAI Service API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/openai-service) or Commercial [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/) for ChatKnights dependencies
* Your preferred code editor (I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/popoway/goknights.git
   ```
2. Install dependency packages
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Enter your API keys in `.env`:
   ```
   # example .env file
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_key_here
   UPLOAD_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=google_play_keystore
   OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint (ex. api.openai.com)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   OPENAI_API_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   ```
4. You're all set! Run the app with `flutter run` or your preferred editor.

To generate a _release_ build for iOS without codesign, run the following command:
```
flutter build ios --release --no-codesign
```

To build an Android app bundle for submission, run the following command:
```
flutter build appbundle
```
